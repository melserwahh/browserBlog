    I was intrigued by the Day UI challenge, an 100-day challenge introduced by a UX companion where you had to ideate and design the UI of an app or a specific aspect of an app every single day.
    By the end of the 100 days, you’ll improve on your design skills and increase your knowledge in design principles.

    I designed the interface of an app that allows you check and monitor your credit score. 
    Below the graph is a diagram which indicates the colour and the range associated with the credit score.
    The colour determines your credit score improvement and credit borrowing eligibility.
    The app allows you access courses and services to help you learn and improve your credit score (via the hamburger menu). 
    Users can learn more about how credit cards work and how it plays a role in decisions like purchasing a house, a car or taking out a loan. 
    Users can also access tips and information that they can apply in their financial habits to boost their credit score points each month.

This is a personal project that I designed to improve my UI skills and get comfortable using Adobe XD.
The left prototype is for iPhone and the right is Android. 
Although I did not participate in the UI challenge as I was not comfortable with Adobe XD, I felt that this design could help me get adjusted to the extent where I could do my own 30, 60 or 90 day challenge.
This credit score app was my very first attempt of playing around with XD, and I was quite satisfied with the design. 
Of course, there are some things I could have improved on, but it boosted my confidence using XD and I enjoyed the designing process.

    <h2>My Angle</h2>

    One thing that young adults are not familiar with are credit score systems and how it affects either short term or long term financial investments. 
    Credit scores are important when considering buying a home, a car, making a large purchase or taking out a loan. 
    A few studies conducted in the early 2000’s showed high levels of credit card debt amongst college students. 
    This is because in the early 2000’s it was much easier for a credit card company to get permission to advertise their services on campuses. 
    A study conducted by Norvilitis, Szablicki, and Wilson (2006) concluded that a lack of knowledge of credit cards and financial issues and attitudes of money led to higher amounts of debt.
    Today, knowledge on credit card scores are still common. The purpose of this app was not only to help users track their credit card score but also learn about how credit score works in terms for financial investments.
    I also wanted the app to provide a way(s) of helping users increase their credit score by a number of points based on a certain time period (one month, three months and so on).
