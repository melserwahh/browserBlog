    The Branding Guide is also another project from my Graphic Design 3 class. 
    In the first half of my Graphic Design 3, the course focused on branding, and we designed a few smaller projects that can be used to brand yourself as a graphic designer.
    The Branding Guide is a 5-page interactive pdf created using Adobe InDesign.
    The guide is the final component of the branding package.
    It packages all the necessary information into an interactive pdf for clients or stakeholders.
    It also includes a simple and clean navigational UI that allows the reader to move from page to page.

The second page, the logo page, provides the various logo formats permitted for use. 
This includes CMYK, Black, Greyscale and Reverse white versions, as well as the minimum size.

On the third page is the brand colours. It provides the information on the primary brand colours and also provides alternative colours that may be used on the logo.

The typography page outlines the family and secondary fonts and font families used in the logo design.

  Finally, the last page of the guide outlines the improper uses of the logo and contact information.

  This project is by far one of my favourite projects designed in this class. 
    I significantly improved and became more comfortable using Adobe Illustrator and Adobe InDesign.
    The Branding Guide is a professional package that allows you to present design ideas, logo, brand colours, structure and other information to future clients.
    The Branding Guide is a project that I will be definitely redesigning in the future and using it to present logos and other design-related ideas.
