 <h3>User-centered design is my priority.</h3>
 <br>
 Hi, my name is Melody. I am a UX/UI Designer in training based in Canada. 
 My educational career expands on design thinking, prototyping, user-research, web design, graphic design, information architecture and other ux-related areas.
I am passionate about problem solving and designing products and systems that are usable, inclusive and attractive. 
<br>
<br>
As a young and emerging designer, my design philosophy is attractive, human-centered design.
I believe that good design stems from the value provided to the user, and the value is determined by how much the user's needs are prioritized throughout a design from start to finish. I also believe that design should be attractive, aesthetically pleasing and evoking.
<br>
<br>
In my free time I enjoy listening to music, watching tv shows and spending time on social media, especially Twitter.
